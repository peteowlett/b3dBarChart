b3dBarChart
===========

Blender script to procedurally create 3D bar charts from source data.

To use the script, open Blender then run the script from the text management frame. You'll need to make the script to a local csv file containing an NxN numeric matrix without headers.

An example render is included (3dBarChartExample.png).
